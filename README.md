## Game Plan
### Overview
Dwarf Fortress clone. Procedurally generated world. You run a world, where you you control things like taxes, weather, laws, etc. You start with ~100 people.

### People Plan
ToDo:
- Design class for people
- Get people interacting with environment
- Money system so people can trades goods for money
- Tax system any trade 20% rounded up gets taxed to you so you can buy more trees and things

Development:
- Created a dictionary containing the different job options and how many woker in each. This was used in the getJob function to get a number for the probability of what the job assigned should be based on the workers there already are. Less wokers means higher probability of that specific job being assigned.
- Created a getName function which selects a random first and last name from their respective files.

### World Plan
